## J.P. Morgan - "Code for Good" 2017 Hackathon - Requirements/Challenge

**Context:**

Wholesome Wave partners with doctors to provide shoppers/patients with innovative fruit and vegetable prescriptions. Participating providers enroll shoppers/patients into the program for 4-5 months at a time. Doctors and nutritionists provide $1/per day/per household member in produce prescriptions, which can be redeemed for fresh produce at participating markets and grocery stores.

**Challenge Statement:**

Your challenge is to help Wholesome Wave develop a mobile application that digitizes the prescription / voucher process. Participants can leave a doctorâ€™s office with a QR code or download link download the app and secure some baseline credit ($1 day/per household member for 4 to 5 months).
Once the participants have the mobile app and have registered their account on the mobile app, they should be able to lookup participating grocery stores and markets on the app.
When they visit a participating store in person and buy fresh produce, those participating stores should be able to apply the digital voucher to their transaction, like a digital coupon, for some or all of the voucher amount based on the total spend for fruits and vegetables. The individual will then keep a running balance and be able to have a physician "reload" their balance after certain steps are taken (i.e. the next wellness visit, attendance to a nutrition education class, completing an online nutrition education course, etc).
